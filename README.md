# Black Ops III Zombies Solo Easter Eggs

### Ascension
* For 3-player games and below, the monkey round buttons have a delay of 100.5 seconds rather than the normal 0.5 seconds, allowing them all to be pressed in time
* In Solo, Lunar Landers automatically collect the letters when in sufficient proximity to them
* Matryoshka dolls are not needed for Solo in the final Gersh Device weapon combo step

### Shangri-La
* For 3-player games and below, the Eclipse mode buttons have a delay of 10 seconds rather than the normal 1 second, allowing them all to be pressed in time
* Tile-matching step is skipped in solo upon pressing the button, this is a stopgap until I can figure out how to make them automatically match when stepping on one
* Pressure plate is considered 'stepped on' by default in Solo so going down the slide successfully hits the switch

## To-do:
[]Replace var_ and function_ with actual names
[]Add a proper solo tile-matching step rather than skipping it
[]GetEnt for Ascension rather than spawning new entities to thread functions on
[]Shadows of Evil
